This repository contains files used to develop a SystemVerilog testbench to verify the design and functionality of an accumulator. The files created encompass the components of a testbench. 

1. Generator
2. Driver
3. Scoreboard
4. Monitor
5. Environment
6. Testbench
7. Interface
8. Test - Program block which tests the DUT - used to avoid races between DUT and TB (program blocks and modules are executed in diff regions)
9. DUT - accumulator
